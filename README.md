# C++ Modules

Welcome to my C++ journey!\
This project is part of the **42 Common Core** curriculum, designed to build a strong foundation in C++ programming—from understanding the basics to writing professional-level code. Over the course of these modules, I explored core C++ features and object-oriented programming concepts that are essential to mastering the language.

I started by learning the fundamentals—how to define and work with classes and objects, use constructors and destructors, and control access using specifiers. As the modules progressed, I dived deeper into memory management with references and pointers, implemented custom types and operator overloading, and explored advanced topics like inheritance, polymorphism, exception handling, and template programming.

This project is structured to guide you step-by-step through each essential C++ topic. By the end, you'll not only grasp how to write clean, efficient, and safe C++ code, but also understand when and why to use different language features—preparing you for real-world development challenges.

## Modules Overview

### CPP Module 00: Introduction to C++ Basics

Covers the basics of object-oriented programming: classes, objects, encapsulation, member functions, and access specifiers. Introduces constructors, destructors, and static members.

### CPP Module 01: Memory, References, and Pointers

Explores memory management fundamentals, including the use of references vs. pointers, dynamic memory allocation, and const correctness.

### CPP Module 02: Fixed-Point Numbers

Introduces fixed-point arithmetic and operator overloading. You'll implement a custom Fixed class and practice overloading operators such as +, -, \*, /, and comparison operators.

### CPP Module 03: Inheritance

Teaches inheritance and the relationship between base and derived classes. Covers constructors/destructors in inheritance and visibility specifiers.

### CPP Module 04: Inheritance and Polymorphism

Builds on Module 03, introducing polymorphism, virtual functions, abstract classes and pure virtual methods.

### CPP Module 05: Exceptions and Bureaucracy

Focuses on exception handling and abstract class design. Implements a bureaucratic workflow to showcase abstract classes, exceptions, and polymorphism.

### CPP Module 06: C++ Type Casting

Delves into C++ casting mechanisms including `static_cast`, `dynamic_cast`, `const_cast`, and `reinterpret_cast`, with practical use cases.

### CPP Module 07: Templates

Covers generic programming using templates. Teaches how to write function and class templates, as well as template specialization.

### CPP Module 08: Containers and Iterators

Introduces the Standard Template Library (STL), sequence containers like `vector`, associative containers like `map`, and how to use iterators with standard algorithms.

### CPP Module 09: STL and Advanced Algorithms

Explores performance optimization with STL, implementing a Bitcoin exchange parser, a Reverse Polish Notation calculator, and hybrid merge-insertion sorting.

## How to Compile

Each module contains its own directory and set of exercises. To compile any of the C++ files:

```bash
c++ -Wall -Wextra -Werror -std=c++98 filename.cpp -o executable
```

Or use a `Makefile` if provided:

```bash
make
```

---

## How to Run

After compilation, simply run the executable:

```bash
./executable
```

Some modules include interactive prompts or input files. Follow the instructions in each module’s README or exercise description.
